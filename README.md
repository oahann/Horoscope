 üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

 Score Generation

Scores are generated using a pseudo-random algorithm based on the selected zodiac sign and date. This ensures that:
- Scores are consistent for the same sign and date
- Values range from 0 to 10
- Each category (health, relationships, career) has its own unique score

 Theme Switching

The theme system works by:
1. Toggling CSS classes on the root HTML element
2. Storing the preference in localStorage
3. Using CSS variables to apply theme-specific colors throughout the application
